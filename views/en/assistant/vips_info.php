        Vips was used in the lecture/exercise "Introduction to Artificial Intelligence",
        to support weekly exercises in groups of up to 3 people. Vips provides for this::
    </p>
    <ol>
        <li>Task sheets can be created with start and end date.</li>
        <li>Both selection questions (multiple choice, cloze texts etc.) as well as free text tasks or file submissions are possible.</li>
        <li>Students can either form groups themselves or be assigned to them. Single submissions are also possible.</li>
        <li>Unambiguous solutions are evaluated automatically, teachers and tutors can always evaluate manually.</li>
        <li>Publication of the results also via Vips.</li>
    </ol>

    <p>&nbsp;<br>
        Activate Vips after closing this dialog via "Activate Vips".
        Then Vips is available for your course then and a sample exercise sheet is imported that shows you the most important task types.
    </p>
<p>The basic actions in Vips are:</p>
<ol>
    <li>Create and manage tasks and self-tests ("task sheets")</li>
    <li>Evaluate submitted solutions and retrieve statistics ("Results")</li>
    <li>Managing exercise groups ("exercise groups")</li>
</ol>

    <h2>Exercise sheets and tasks with deadline: Tips &amp; tricks</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Less is more! <b>Do not use too many different types of tasks</b>, but limit yourself to a few,
            which you explain well.<br>&nbsp;</li>
        <li>Offer a <b>example task sheet</b> with which you and the students can practice.<br>&nbsp;</li>
        <li><b>Multiple submissions</b> are possible, it's always the last submssion of a person or group that counts.<br>&nbsp;</li>
        <li><b>Group changes</b> are also possible. For expired exercise sheets the grades and points of the group valid at the end date. For running task sheets, a person carries their
            submissions to the new group.</li>
    </ul>
