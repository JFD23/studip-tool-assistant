        With the Stud.IP module "Information" you can set up a freely named tab next to "Participants", "Files" etc. in your course and populate it with information as you wish.
    </p>
    <p>
        This allows you to place information that is important for the course in terms of organisation or content in a clearly visible and prominent position.
    </p>
    <p>
        For your students, the question for each course in the upcoming semester is: "How is this course scructured? What do I have to do, where can I find information?"
        With a uniformly placed "Corona info page" structured according to a comparable pattern, you will make it easier for your participants to find their way around.
    </p>
    <p>
        Activate the module "Information" on the "More..." page of your course or directly with the action button "Set up corona info page".
    </p>

        You can also use the information page for other information and even create several sub-categories.
    </p>
    Typical and well-tried ways of use are e.g:
    <ul>
        <li>Placement of a central and clearly visible literature list for the course</li>
        <li>Deposition of important links, e.g. to other platforms, external materials etc.</li>
        <li>Indication of deadlines and arrangements for homework in the course</li>
    </ul>
