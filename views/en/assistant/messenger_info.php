<p>
    A simple form of the messenger is also integrated in Stud.IP.
    The "blubber chat" enables course-related communication that has less structure than a classic forum and is therefore typically perceived as less formal and binding.
</p>
<p>
    The "blubber" chat is particularly useful for answering questions about the event without having to set up a structured forum.
</p>
<p>
    The use with external apps is not possible, blubber is only accessible within Stud.IP.
